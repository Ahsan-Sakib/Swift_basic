//When use class ?
//need a subclass
//one of a kind
//value = identity



//struct good thing

//Simple Data Types
//Thread Safety
//Mostly Structs Scenario
//Donâ€™t Need Inheritance


//Both class and struct

//Both structs and classes can define properties to store values, and they can define functions
//They can define subscripts to provide access to values with subscript syntax
//They can define initializers to set up their initial state, with init()
//They can be extended with extension (this is important!)
//They can conform to protocols, for example to support Protocol Oriented Programming
//They can work with generics to provide flexible and reusable types

//class has

//Classes can inherit from another class, like you inherit from UIViewController to create your own view controller subclass
//Classes can be deinitialized, i.e. you can invoke a deinit() function before the class is destroyed
//Classes are reference types and structs are value types
