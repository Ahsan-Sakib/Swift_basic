// Float is used in the UISlider values. Source: Apple Developer Docs

// The precision of a Double is at least 15 decimal places.
// The precision of a Float can be as small as 6 decimals places.

//You should use Float only if you want to sacrifice precision to save memory. Also, if you are working with types that require Float, then you have to use a Float. For example, UISlider values are Floats.
